100 Days of Code: 'The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023'
Day 1 Log

Today I learned how to work with variables in Python to manage data. This section covered the following topics:
  -Print statements
  -String Manipulation
  -Debugging
  -Input functions
  -Variables
  -Variable naming

This section also covered concatenation ("+"), adding a new line (\n), and the length function ("len()").

This section included four coding exercises and ended with a project. The project (band_name_generator) and its details can be found within the "Project" folder of this ("Day1") repository.
