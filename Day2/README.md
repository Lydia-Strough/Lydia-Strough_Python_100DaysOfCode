# Day 2 Log: Understanding Datatypes and How to Manipulate Strings

Welcome back to my Day 2 log of the "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023"! Today, I dived deeper into the world of Python, exploring primitive data types and mathematical operations. Here's a summary of what I covered:

## Key Topics Covered

- **Primitive Data Types:** I learned about essential data types in Python, including strings, integers, floats, and booleans. Understanding these foundational data types is crucial for building more complex programs.
- **Type Error, Type Checking, Type Conversion:** I gained insights into handling type errors, checking data types using the `type()` function, and converting data between different types.
- **Mathematical Operations:** This section focused on arithmetic operations in Python, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponents. These operations are essential for performing calculations within programs.
- **Number Manipulation and F-strings:** This section covered techniques for manipulating numbers, such as rounding and formatting output using f-strings. F-strings are a powerful way to format strings and include variables seamlessly.

## Coding Exercises

Throughout the day, I completed three coding exercises, each challenging me to apply the concepts I learned, including:

1. **Life in Weeks (Remaining Age Calculator):** In this exercise, I created a Python program that calculates the number of days, weeks, and months a person has left to live if they reach the age of 90. 

## Project: Tip Calculator

The day concluded with the Tip Calculator project. This project aimed to determine how to split a bill, including a tip, based on the number of people and the total cost of the meal. Additionally, users could choose between 10%, 12%, or 15% as the desired tip percentage. This real-world application of Python showcased the practicality and versatility of the language in solving everyday challenges. 

Feel free to explore the "Project" folder to discover the specifics of the Tip Calculator project and how it was implemented.

## Key Takeaways

During this session, I came across two particularly helpful insights:

- **Readable Code with Underscores:** I learned that experienced coders often use underscores to improve readability when dealing with long numbers in Python. For instance, writing `1_000_000` instead of `1000000` makes the number more easily interpretable.

- **Thonny IDE for Beginners:** I discovered the power of using the Thonny IDE for Python, which allowed me to watch the execution of code step by step. This feature proved invaluable during the coding exercises, enhancing my understanding of program flow and debugging.
