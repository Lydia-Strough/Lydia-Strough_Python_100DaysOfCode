## Introduction

Welcome to the Treasure Island Game! This project is part of my progress through the "100 Days of Code" bootcamp, specifically on Day 3. The purpose of this project is to create an interactive text-based game where players navigate a virtual island in search of hidden treasure. The fate of the player's adventure is determined by the choices they make along the way. Make the right choices to find the treasure, but beware of wrong decisions that lead to game over!

## Technology Stack

- IDE: Replit
- Python Version: Python 3.8.12

## Running the Program

To see an example of the running program, please use the following link: [Treasure Island](https://replit.com/@appbrewery/treasure-island-end).

## Directions

1. Launch the game using the provided link.
2. You will find yourself on the shores of Treasure Island, faced with critical decisions at every turn.
3. Read the prompts carefully and choose your path wisely by typing your response.
4. Your choices will determine the outcome of your adventure. Will you uncover the treasure, or will your journey end in failure?
5. Feel the thrill of exploration as you navigate through the story and make choices that shape your destiny.

Embark on this daring quest for treasure, but remember, each choice has consequences. Whether you emerge victorious or meet an untimely end, the journey is yours to command.
