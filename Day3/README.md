# Day 3 Log: Control Flow and Logical Operators

Welcome to my Day 3 log of the "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023"! Today, I immersed myself in the world of control flow and interactive programming, taking on the exciting challenge of creating a Chose-Your-Own-Adventure game. Here's a snapshot of what I explored:

## Key Topics Covered

- **Control Flow with if / else and Conditional Operators:** I delved into the fascinating world of control flow, using if and else statements to make decisions based on conditions. The use of conditional operators such as `>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=` allowed me to evaluate expressions and guide the program's behavior accordingly.
- **Modulo:** I learned about the modulo operator `%`, which calculates the remainder of a division operation. This proved incredibly handy in scenarios like checking for even or odd numbers.
- **Nested if Statements and elif Statements:** I uncovered the power of nested if statements and the `elif` (else if) statement, enabling multi-layered decision-making based on multiple conditions.
- **Multiple if Statements in Succession:** By employing multiple if statements in succession, I could evaluate and react to several conditions simultaneously.
- **Logical Operators:** I explored logical operators `and`, `or`, and `not`, which allowed me to create complex conditions by combining simpler ones.

## Coding Exercises

Throughout the day, I completed five coding exercises, each challenging me to apply the concepts I learned, including:

1. **Love Calculator:** In this exercise, I created a program that calculates the compatibility between two people by analyzing the occurrence of specific letters in their names. By counting the letters in the words TRUE and LOVE, I could determine a "love score" that represents their compatibility level.

## Game: Treasure Island

The day concluded with a Chose-Your-Own-Adventure game. In this project, I developed a text-based game where players navigate through a series of choices that lead to different outcomes. The goal is to uncover the hidden treasure while avoiding perilous paths that lead to a game over. 

Feel free to explore the game under the "Project" folder to play the game and discover the specifics as to how it was implemented. 

## Key Takeaway

An interesting takeaway from today's session was observing how differently brains work â€” specifically, comparing my thought process during coding exercises to that of the instructor. It highlighted the diverse approaches to problem-solving and how various perspectives contribute to the coding journey.
