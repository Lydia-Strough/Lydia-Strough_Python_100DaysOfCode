# Lydia-Strough_Python_100DaysOfCode

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code Bootcamp log! This repository serves as a documentation of my journey through the "Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023" on Udemy. In this bootcamp I will be diving deep into Python programming, data analysis, and machine learning.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders for each day of the bootcamp. Each day's folder contains a README file summarizing the concepts, topics, and exercises covered on that particular day. Additionally, if I have completed any projects during the day, you'll find a "Project" folder within the day's folder, containing a separate README file and any necessary project files.

For example:
- **Day N**: DayN/README.txt/Project/project_name/README.txt/...

## Progress and Updates

I will be regularly updating this repository with my progress as I work through the bootcamp. You can expect detailed explanations, code samples, and possibly some insights or reflections on my learning experience.

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to navigate through the repository and explore each day's folder to follow along with my progress. You can check out the README files to get an overview of the concepts covered on a particular day. If you're interested in the projects I've completed, head over to the respective project folder to find the project-specific README and associated files.
